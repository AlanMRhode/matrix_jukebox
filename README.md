My group partner was https://github.com/PhilAraujo. This collaborative assignment was to use JavaScript to make the coolest juke joint in the place! Using any mp3s we streamed online, we created a simple web page where you can play them. We used JavaScript functions that can pause, play, and stop the Jukebox. We also encapsulated all of this functionality in a JavaScript object so that starting a song is as simple as calling: Jukebox.play()
